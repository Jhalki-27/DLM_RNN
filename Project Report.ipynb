    "2. Early Convergence & Overfitting Signs  \n",
    "   - Training accuracy improved rapidly from 72.16% (Epoch 1) to 98.46% (Epoch 8), suggesting quick learning. However, validation accuracy peaked early (86.88% at Epoch 2) and then fluctuated, indicating possible overfitting.  \n",

    "5. Potential Improvements  \n",
    "   - Regularization Techniques (Dropout, L2 Weight Decay) could help reduce overfitting.  \n",
